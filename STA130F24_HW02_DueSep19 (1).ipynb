    "In the last section, we discussed a **streamlined version of the Monty Hall problem simulation** using a Markov chain, which involves running the simulation 100,000 times to assess the probability of winning if the contestant always switches doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points of the Streamlined Code:\n",
    "1. **Simplified Structure**:\n",
    "   - The code uses concise list comprehensions and efficient random selection to handle the Monty Hall problem.\n",
    "   - A random winning door and an initial choice are made, followed by Monty revealing a goat behind one of the doors.\n",
    "   - The contestant then switches doors, and the program checks if the new door is the winning one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Readability**:\n",
    "   - Instead of detailed exception handling and multiple steps, the streamlined version condenses the logic into a clear structure without unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "   - The simulation repeats for a specified number of iterations (`100,000`), and the probability of winning by switching is printed at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "This streamlined version improves both clarity and efficiency while maintaining the core logic of the Monty Hall problem simulation.<br>\n",

    "In this section of the session, we discussed how a **Markov chain** can be used for **text generation**, particularly for building a **Markovian chatbot**. Here's a summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concept of Markov Chains**: \n",
    "   - A Markov chain model analyzes sequences of words in the text to predict the next word based on the current one, using probabilities learned from the input corpus (e.g., stories with different characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example Code**: \n",
    "   - We provided Python code that:\n",
    "     1. Splits a sample story into words.\n",
    "     2. Builds a dictionary where each word is mapped to a list of words that can follow it.\n",
    "     3. Generates new text by starting with a word and using the dictionary to randomly select the next word in the sequence, creating a coherent passage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Features of the Code**:\n",
    "   - **Markov Chain Creation**: Using a dictionary to track word transitions.\n",
    "   - **Text Generation**: Starting from a given word, the text is generated by selecting random successors based on the Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extensions**:\n",
    "   - The code can be improved by using **higher-order Markov chains**, handling punctuation better, and refining start/end conditions to create more structured and natural-sounding sentences.\n",

    "    The Chatbot was not able to be helpful in a very consice manner for the first part of question 5. It did understand the code extensions, but it was not very helpful to me in the sense that it was providing me with too many details and ways to alter the code which was not what I was looking for. It explained what some of the variables meant which was useful but otherwise, it was not a very streamlined answer. <br><br>\n",

    "    For the third part of question 5, I found that when I opened a new Chatbot session and jumped straight to the final version of the code, it explained it the best. This gave me a streamlined and concise explanation to the code, unlike providing the extension codes one-by-one.<br><br>\n",
    "2. Discuss whether or not interacting with ChatBot to try to figure things out was frustrating or unhelpful, and if so, how?<br><br>\n",
    "    Interacting with the Chatbot to try to figure things out was a bit frustrating at times since it was giving me a lot of unnecessary information which slightly confused me. It also tried to alter the code that I was giving it which was not what I asked for. However, whenever I asked specific questions, it was very helpful. I did not find that interacting with the Chatbot was unhelpful.<br><br>\n",
    "3. Based on your experiences to date (e.g., including using ChatBots to troubleshoot coding errors in the previous homework), provide an overall assessment evaluating the usefulness of ChatBots as tools to help you understand code<br><br>\n",
    "I find that Chatbots are a very useful tool to help me understand code. It breaks down the code for me step-by-step and the best part is that I can continue asking it follow up questions or ask it to explain it in a different way if I still do not understand it. Although they can provide unnecessary information at times, overall, they are still very useful. They haven't provided me with incorrect information yet about my code, and are usually pretty accurate for understanding a piece of code or the coding concepts behind it. Chatbots feel like a personal tutor. "

    "\n",
    "In this session, we explored extensions to your **Markovian chatbot** using bigrams and character-specific speech patterns. Here's a summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Markovian Chatbot Extension #1**: \n",
    "   - Introduced bigram (two-word sequence) modeling to improve the chatbot’s ability to predict the next word with more context. The code stores counts of bigrams and the next possible words.\n",
    "   - **Key Concepts**: \n",
    "     - `word_used2`: Counts occurrences of bigrams in the text.\n",
    "     - `next_word2`: Tracks words that follow a given bigram.\n",
    "   - This extension makes the chatbot’s responses more coherent by considering word pairs when generating text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Markovian Chatbot Extension #2**:\n",
    "   - Added character-specific speech modeling, allowing the chatbot to generate responses based on how specific characters in the dataset speak.\n",
    "   - **Key Concepts**:\n",
    "     - `word_used2C`: Stores bigram frequencies for each character.\n",
    "     - `next_word2C`: Tracks what words are likely to follow each bigram for each character.\n",
    "   - This allows the chatbot to mimic individual characters’ speech patterns by generating text using a separate Markov chain for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Differences Between `word_used2C` and `next_word2C`**:\n",
    "   - `word_used2C` counts how often a specific bigram occurs for a character.\n",
    "   - `next_word2C` tracks which third word follows a bigram and how often it occurs, allowing the chatbot to predict the next word in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "These extensions allow your chatbot to generate more contextually appropriate and character-specific text, improving its conversational quality and personality.\n",

    "Since I started using Chatbots in this course, my opinion of AI tools has definitely changed. At first, I wasn’t sure how helpful they would be, especially when it came to learning things like statistics and coding. I thought that they could not explain the code to me and could only write some code. However, I’ve seen how useful they can be in explaining things I didn’t understand or showing me examples when I was stuck.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The chatbot is pretty good at breaking down complex ideas into simpler terms, whether it's about data cleaning, variables, or understanding some statistical concept. I also noticed that it can explain things over and over in different ways until it clicks, which helps when I’m learning something new. I can ask the Chatbot to explain certain concepts to me like I'm a fifth-grader for example and it will break it down for me even further if I don't understand. It also helps with coding because it shows examples and points out where my mistakes are without me having to wait for feedback from a teacher or a TA.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "I know that Chatbots have some limits at times. They don’t always understand my questions exactly, and sometimes the explanations are not very concise and include unnecessary information about the code that doesn't make sense to me right now as a beginner in programming. Overall however, I think it has been a good tool. It is a really dynamic resource that can adapt its answers and explanations based on what I need from it and how I learn. \n",
